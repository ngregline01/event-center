        movement. Through inspiring events, mentorship link-ups, scholarship opportunities, and storytelling workshops, 
        we create space for students to thrive, connect, and be seen.Our mission is to fuel the dreams of those
         navigating new academic and cultural landscapes by providing tools, opportunities, and a strong support network. 
        Whether you're pitching your vision at our Fuel My Future night, finding hands-on experience through volunteer events, 
        or getting matched with a mentor who gets your journey — we are here to back you every step of the way.
        We don’t just help you earn a degree — we fuel the future behind it.</em></article>
